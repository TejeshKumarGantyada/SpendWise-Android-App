## üöÄ Setup & Installation

To run this project, you will need Android Studio, Node.js, and the Firebase CLI.

### 1. Firebase Project Setup

1. Create a new project in the Firebase Console.
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google providers), Firestore, Storage, and Functions.
3. Upgrade your project to the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan to use Functions.
4. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `SpendWise/app/` directory of the Android project.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE**
Before you commit your code, you **MUST** add the `google-services.json` file to your project's root `.gitignore`. This prevents secret API keys from being uploaded to a public repository.

Add this line to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
google-services.json
```

### 2. Backend (Firebase Functions)

1. Navigate to the `spendwise-functions/functions` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. Create a file named `.env` in this directory.
4. Get your Google Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.
5. Create a Google Sheet for data export and get its ID from the URL.
6. Add your secrets to the `.env` file:

```env
SPENDWISE_SHEET_ID="YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID"
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

7. Follow the project guide to set up a Service Account and share your Google Sheet with it.
8. Deploy the functions by running:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

from the root `spendwise-functions` directory.

### 3. Frontend (Android App)

1. Open the SpendWise Android project in Android Studio.
2. Let Gradle sync all dependencies.
3. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.
